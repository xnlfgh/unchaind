########

``unchaind`` is a tool for EVE Online groups that use wormhole space. It offers
several tools on your Discord to make your life easier. These include automatic
notifications for kills happening in your chain, systems being found in your
chain and/or specific notifications for new systems in jump range. It can also
be used as a generic killbot which can filter kills in many ways.
